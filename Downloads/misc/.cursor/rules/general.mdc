- Don't summarize changes
- Don't dry run or type check or build code
- Don't explain unless specifically requested
- Preserve original comments, but don't add more
- Output all edits in a single message instead of multiple-step instructions for the same file
- Keep code simple, performant
- Use concise function/variable names but don't abbreviate (e.g. Use "event" over "e")
- camelCase for functions/variables, PascalCase for types/classes
- Avoid `handle` prefix on handlers, use `on` because it's short (e.g. onClick, onSubmit)
- Use verb phrases for actions (e.g. save, verify)
- Use == for equality checks, not ===
- Use `Boolean(variable)` over `!!variable`
- Prefer single-line ifs `if (condition) return`
- Follow this `.prettierrc`:
  ```
  semi: false
  singleQuote: true
  trailingComma: none
  arrowParens: avoid
  ```
- Use bun.js instead of node. (e.g. `bun add`)
